## Aim  
- To study conditional statements in Python  
- To understand decision-making in Python programs  



## Objectives  
- To understand the concept of conditional execution  
- To use `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements  
- To apply conditional statements in simple programs  



## Theory  

### 1. Introduction to Conditional Statements  
Conditional statements are used in Python to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. They allow a program to make decisions and control the flow of execution. Conditions are evaluated as either true or false.



### 2. If Statement  
- The `if` statement executes a block of code only when a given condition is true.  
- It is the simplest form of conditional control.  
- If the condition is false, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.



### 3. If–Else Statement  
- The `if-else` statement provides an alternative block of code.  
- If the condition is true, the `if` block is executed; otherwise, the `else` block is executed.  
- It is used when exactly one of two actions must be performed.



### 4. If–Elif–Else Statement  
- The `if-elif-else` statement is used to check multiple conditions.  
- Conditions are evaluated sequentially from top to bottom.  
- The first condition that evaluates to true is executed, and the rest are skipped.


### 5. Nested Conditional Statements  
- Conditional statements can be placed inside other conditional statements.  
- This allows more complex decision-making based on multiple conditions.



## Conclusion  
- This experiment demonstrates the use of conditional statements in Python.  
- Conditional statements are essential for decision-making and program control.  
- Understanding these concepts is fundamental for writing logical and efficient Python programs.
